<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this project. Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the project.</p>

<h2 align="middle">Part I: Masses and springs</h2>
<strong>
Take some screenshots of scene/pinned2.json from a viewing angle where you can clearly see the cloth wireframe to show the structure of your point masses and springs.

<h2 align="middle">Part II: Masses and springs</h2>
<strong>
Experiment with some the parameters in the simulation. To do so, pause the simulation at the start with P, modify the values of interest, and then resume by pressing P again. You can also restart the simulation at any time from the cloth's starting position by pressing R.

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Describe the effects of changing the spring constant ks; how does the cloth behave from start to rest with a very low ks? And for high ks?</strong>
    <p>For high k_s, there just seems to be more general stiffness of the cloth as it begins to rest after falling. The opposite occurs for low k_s: the cloth seems to be very loose and move quite gracefully as it falls. Also low k_s gives a very droopy look to the cloth after it’s reached it’s resting position. Also less creases.</p>

              <figcaption align="left">High k_{s} value</figcaption>
              <img src="images/part2lowks.png" width="480px" />
              <figcaption align="left">Low k_{s} value</figcaption>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>What about for density?</strong>
    <p>Density just seems to change the weight of the cloth. As density increases, the cloth looks to pull stronger and stronger at the two pinned points in it. As density decreases, the cloth stays further up at rest meaning it tugs less at the pinned point masses.</p>

              <figcaption align="left">High density value</figcaption>
              <img src="images/part2lowdensity.png" width="480px" />
              <figcaption align="left">Low density value</figcaption>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>What about for damping?</strong>
    <p>Damping seems to control the speed at which the cloth falls and comes to a steady state (specifically just hanging still). Low damping also causes erratic behavior with the cloth. Presumably because it causes the verlet integration error to amplify?</p>

              <figcaption align="left">High density value</figcaption>

<strong>
Vary the density as well as ks and describe with words and screenshots how they affect the behavior of the cloth as it falls on itself.
</strong>
<p>
Varying the cloth via ks and density seem to have inverse effects. Increasing the density of the cloth leads to the cloth wrinkling a lot less on it’s way down and just falling straight down in a fast manner. This same pattern occurs when the ks value of the cloth is decreased. Now decreasing density of the cloth or also increasing the ks value of the cloth leads to the cloth bending and folding on itself a lot more as it falls down.
